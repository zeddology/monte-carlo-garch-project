# Monte Carlo Simulation with GARCH(1,1) Model for Option Pricing

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation for pricing European call options, using volatility estimated from a GARCH(1,1) model. It compares simulated prices with those calculated using the Black-Scholes formula.

## 📈 Features

- 📊 Monte Carlo Simulation for European options
- ⚡ GARCH(1,1) model for estimating time-varying volatility
- 💹 Historical stock data using `yfinance`
- 📐 Comparison with traditional Black-Scholes pricing

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- `yfinance`, `arch` (for GARCH)
- `scipy.stats` (for Black-Scholes)
